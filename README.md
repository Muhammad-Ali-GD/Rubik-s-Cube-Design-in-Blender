# Rubik-s-Cube-Design-in-Blender



Design



Check out this amazing Rubik's Cube design created in Blender by me! Despite its compact appearance, it's super easy to make using a sequence of 27 cubes with colored planes and a black plastic texture. The wooden base with reduced roughness adds a classic, shiny look that reflects the cube itself. To top it off, the addition of an HDRI not only provides a background but also creates an awesome lighting effect.
